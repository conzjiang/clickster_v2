This is the new and improved version of Clickster (https://github.com/conzjiang/clickster)!

New features:

* Mobile-first design!
* Everything in Backbone!
* More optimized search queries!

== TODO

* Boyer-Moore algorithm for faster search lookup
* Search for "Law & Order: Special Victims Unit" with `SVU` keyword
* Going back when search form is open keeps search bar on the page
* Ugh, can't find a nice way to render title block above rating in search results
